# Creating Documentation for IEEE 29148: Requirements Engineering

IEEE 29148 refers to the IEEE Standard for Systems and Software Engineering—Life Cycle Processes—Requirements Engineering. This standard provides guidelines for the processes of requirements engineering and management throughout the life cycle of a system or software product.

## 1. Introduction

- Overview of the document's purpose and scope.
- Definitions and acronyms used throughout the document.

## 2. System Overview

- High-level description of the system or software product.
- Context within the larger environment.

## 3. Stakeholder Requirements

- Identification and description of stakeholders and their concerns.
- Stakeholder requirements, including functional and non-functional requirements.

## 4. System Requirements

- Functional requirements specifying the behavior of the system.
- Non-functional requirements such as performance, reliability, and security.

## 5. External Interface Requirements

- Requirements related to interfaces with external systems or components.
- Communication protocols and data interchange formats.

## 6. System Features

- Detailed descriptions of specific features or functionalities.
- Use cases or user scenarios illustrating how the system will be used.

## 7. Performance Requirements

- Quantifiable measures related to system performance.
- Response times, throughput, and other relevant metrics.

## 8. Design Constraints

- Constraints that may impact the design and implementation.
- Legal, regulatory, or organizational constraints.

## 9. Quality Attributes

- Requirements related to quality attributes such as reliability, maintainability, and usability.
- Standards and criteria for evaluating these attributes.

## 10. Verification and Validation Requirements

- Criteria and methods for verifying and validating requirements.
- Testing and acceptance criteria.

## 11. Traceability Matrix

- Traceability links between requirements and their sources, and other related artifacts.
- A means to track changes and ensure completeness.

## 12. Appendices

- Any additional information or documentation that supports the requirements.
- Prototypes, mock-ups, or supplementary materials.

It's important to note that IEEE 29148 emphasizes the importance of traceability, completeness, and consistency in requirements documentation. The document should be clear, unambiguous, and organized to facilitate effective communication between stakeholders, designers, and developers throughout the software or system life cycle.

Always refer to the latest version of the IEEE standards for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
