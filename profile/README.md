## Gungnir: The Intelligent Python Agent

**Empowering Remote Execution with Precision**

*Gungnir*, named after the legendary Norse spear of Odin, stands as the Python-based agent at the heart of the Vaskaktusz project. Engineered for intelligence and efficiency, *Gungnir* is the conduit through which users remotely execute code on distributed machines. With its versatility and adherence to security best practices, *Gungnir* serves as a reliable companion for developers, system administrators, and IT professionals seeking a dynamic and secure remote code execution solution.

**Secure Authorization and Beyond**

*Gungnir*'s authorization mechanism goes beyond the ordinary, providing users with a spectrum of options. While the default authentication leverages the OS username and password, *Gungnir* offers heightened security through public-private key pairs, tokens, and multi-factor authentication (MFA). With *Gungnir*, users can confidently execute code, knowing that their interactions with remote machines are fortified by secure HTTPS channels, encryption, and stringent authentication protocols.

**Health Checks and Seamless Integration**

*Gungnir*'s commitment to user-centricity extends to health checks, ensuring that users have real-time visibility into the well-being of connected agents. By regularly reporting status to the *Skofnung* backend, *Gungnir* enables the automatic refreshing of the user interface. This seamless integration facilitates proactive monitoring, allowing users to respond swiftly to any anomalies or issues that may arise in the remote execution environment.

## Skofnung: The Backend Component

**Empowering the Core Functionality**

*Skofnung*, named after the legendary sword of the Danish king Hr√≥lf Kraki, serves as the backend component that complements Gungnir's capabilities. It provides the core functionality of managing and coordinating the remote code execution process, ensuring seamless communication between agents and the user interface.

**Comprehensive Agent Health Status Table**

At the core of *Skofnung*'s functionality is a comprehensive table detailing the health status of connected agents. Users gain insights into critical metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk space, all presented in real-time. This backend component allows users to monitor the well-being of their remote machines effortlessly, enabling proactive maintenance and swift issue resolution.

## Dainsleif: The Centralized Web Component and User Interface (UI)

**A Command Center for Effortless Management**

*Dainsleif*, named after the mythical sword of Norse legend, serves as the centralized web component that transforms Vaskaktusz into a command center for remote code execution. The *Dainsleif* UI is designed with a user-friendly interface, providing users with a comprehensive and intuitive platform to manage, monitor, and execute code on remote machines seamlessly.

**Effortless Code Execution with Intuitive Menu Elements**

*Dainsleif*'s UI simplifies the code execution process, offering an intuitive menu element for securely uploading code destined for remote execution. Users benefit from real-time updates on the execution status, providing clear feedback on the outcome of their requests. *Dainsleif*'s design emphasizes transparency, ensuring users remain informed at every stage of the code execution process.
